<h2>The experience of mind</h2>
    <p>
 wandering – which tends, now, <b>to be placed by the  discipline of psychology under the umbrella term</b> &lsquo;self-generated thought&rsquo; ,  along with associated states such as daydream, fantasy and reverie – is recognized as a ubiquitous component of everyday life.<ol>
     <li>[I]n day-dreaming&rsquo;,  CHAPTER 4  Writing and Daydreaming  Hazel Morrison  H. Morrison (*)  Durham University, Durham, United Kingdom  <u>e-mail: hazel.morrison@durham.ac.uk</u>  28 H. MORRISON  wrote Jerome Singer, &lsquo;all of us are in a sense authorities because of the  very private nature of our experiences&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Yet when looking to the history  of psychological research that underpins contemporary understandings of  mind wandering, &lsquo;all of us&rsquo;, that is, the generic you and I who experience our minds wandering every day, are notably absent. This isn&rsquo;t to say  that the voices, experiences and narratives of everyday people are entirely  obscured. Rather the reliability – or, one might say, the authority – of the  subjective viewpoint is repeatedly denigrated.</li>
<li>This, argue Schooler and Schreiber, is because although our experience of mind wandering is in itself undeniable, our ability to accurately  represent our experience is frequently inadequate.</li> 
<li>A momentary loss of  &lsquo;meta-cognition&rsquo;, or self-reflexive awareness of our mental state, <u>is commonly recognized to characterize the transition to the mind wandering  state</u>.</li>
<li>And if we are unable to recognize our minds having wandered,  the validity of our accounts of these fugitive mental processes must be  questionable. There are historical precedents to this problematic.</li>
</ol>

 <blockquote cite="#">Psychologist William James, for example, famously compared the attempt to  capture such fleeting subjectivity as that of grasping</blockquote>
 <p>a spinning top to  catch its motion, or trying to turn up the gas quickly enough to see how  the darkness looks&rsquo;.6 <em>I agree that the aforementioned denigration of the authority of subjective experience may be traced to this long-standing issue of meta-cognition</em>,  and its absence during periods of mind wandering. However, <u>James recognized a second impediment to introspection</u>, which, until recently, has  received little attention within mainstream psychology.</p>

  <h2>The psychological vocabulary for describing  internally generated mental content</h2>
  </p>This he identified  as the limitation of language, claiming an &lsquo;<b>absence of a special vocabulary  for subjective facts</b>&rsquo;, which hindered the study of all &lsquo;but the very coarsest  of them&rsquo;. <em>7 More than a century on, Callard, Smallwood and Margulies,</em> in  a commentary on scientific investigations of the mind at &lsquo;rest&rsquo;, recognize  a similar problematic. A &lsquo;historical bias&rsquo;, they write, &lsquo;toward explicating  external processing has meant the psychological vocabulary for describing  internally generated mental content is relatively stunted.&rsquo;8   Nonetheless,  they suggest there exist pockets of literature, now &lsquo;largely unknown or  disregarded in cognitive psychology&rsquo; which once used heterogeneous  methods to study and elicit states of &lsquo;daydream, fantasy, mind wandering  and dissociation&rsquo;.9  To bring some of these methods to greater visibility, this chapter looks  back to the period 1908–23, a period during which daydream and fantasy  were experimentally explored through diverse introspective practices,   4 Writing and Daydreamin g 29  ranging from the free association methods of psychoanalysis to stream  of consciousness literary techniques. Reading Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s famous  essay &lsquo;Creative Writers and Day-Dreaming&rsquo; (1908), in relation both to  his daughter Anna Freud&rsquo;s essay &lsquo;The Relation of Beating-Phantasies to a  Day-Dream&rsquo; (1923) and to Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s short story &lsquo;The Mark on the  Wall&rsquo; (1919), this chapter explores the place of writing within complexes  of daydream and fantasy. <b>These interconnected texts make clear the complexities of articulating inner</b>, mental phenomena through the medium of  the written word. In so doing, they offer additional paths through which  we might understand why the subjective viewpoint has often been denigrated or downplayed within the history of daydreaming and mind wandering research.</p>
